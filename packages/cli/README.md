# servercn

Opinionated backend component installer for Node.js applications.

`servercn` helps you scaffold and install **production-ready backend components**
(logging, auth, validation, error handling, etc.) into an existing project —
similar in spirit to `shadcn/ui`, but for **backend infrastructure**.
