# Introduction

**ServerCN** is a component-based system for building backend applications with Node.js and TypeScript.

It’s not a framework.  
It’s a way to compose your backend using reusable, copy-pasteable components that you fully own.

Instead of relying on heavy abstractions, ServerCN lets you add only what you need—auth, validation, error handling, and more—directly into your codebase.

## Philosophy

ServerCN brings the **shadcn/ui** approach to the backend:

- Own your code — no hidden runtime dependencies.
- Add features as components, not packages.
- Adapt to your architecture, not the other way around.

## Why ServerCN?

Backend projects often struggle with structure and consistency as they grow. ServerCN provides:

- Proven backend patterns
- Clean and scalable folder structure
- TypeScript-first components
- CLI-driven component installation

You get production-ready building blocks without losing control.

## Core Principles

- **Open Code** — Components are copied into your project.
- **Composable** — Build features by combining small modules.
- **Architecture Agnostic** — Works with Express, Fastify, Next.js, and more.
- **AI-Friendly** — Explicit, predictable code that works well with AI tools.

## What ServerCN is Not

- Not a framework
- Not an ORM
- Not a black box

It complements your existing stack instead of replacing it.
