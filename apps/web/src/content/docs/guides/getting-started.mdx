# Introduction

ServerCN is a **component-based backend development system** for Node.js and TypeScript.

It helps you build backends the same way you build modern UIs:  
by composing small, predictable, and reusable components—**without frameworks owning your code**.

ServerCN is **open code**, **CLI-driven**, and **architecture-aware**.  
It works with Express, Next.js, and custom Node.js backends.

> This is not a backend framework.  
> **It is how you build your backend framework.**

## The Problem With Traditional Backends

Most backend tooling follows one of these patterns:

- Install a large framework
- Accept a rigid architecture
- Customize through configuration and overrides
- Fight abstractions when requirements grow

This works—until you need to:

- Change how auth is structured
- Share logic across services
- Adapt to a different architecture
- Remove or replace a feature cleanly

At that point, you are no longer building your backend.  
You are **working around it**.

## What ServerCN Solves

ServerCN removes the abstraction wall.

Instead of shipping behavior hidden inside libraries, ServerCN gives you **real backend code** that lives inside your project and follows **your architecture**.

You install backend features the same way you install UI components:

- Authentication
- Error handling
- Validation
- Hashing
- Database utilities
- Middleware patterns

Each feature is **copied into your codebase**, not imported at runtime.

You own it completely.

## Core Principles

ServerCN is built around a small set of strict principles.

## Open Code

ServerCN installs **actual source code** into your project.

There is:

- No runtime dependency
- No hidden behavior
- No locked abstractions

You can:

- Read every line
- Modify anything
- Delete what you don’t need
- Commit it like your own code

If something breaks, you debug **your code**, not a black box.

## Composition

Every ServerCN component follows consistent patterns.

If a feature doesn’t exist:

- It is added as a composable unit
- It integrates cleanly with existing components
- It respects shared conventions

This makes your backend:

- Predictable for developers
- Understandable for AI tools
- Easier to extend without refactoring

## Distribution

ServerCN is also a **code distribution system**.

It uses:

- A flat component registry
- Explicit dependency definitions
- A CLI to install features safely

This allows you to:

- Share backend components across projects
- Add features incrementally
- Generate new components using AI that follow the same structure

## Opinionated, Yet Flexible

ServerCN ships with **best-practice defaults**:

- Secure by default
- Production-oriented
- Real-world tested patterns

But nothing is enforced.

You can:

- Change file locations
- Adjust patterns
- Replace logic
- Integrate with existing codebases

ServerCN adapts to **your architecture**, not the other way around.

## Architecture-Aware

ServerCN detects and respects your project structure.

It works with:

- MVC
- Feature-based architecture
- Clean architecture
- Custom folder layouts

Components are generated to fit your project—not reshape it.

## AI-Ready

Because ServerCN installs **open, readable code**:

- LLMs can understand your backend
- Generate new features consistently
- Suggest improvements that fit your system

AI works **with your code**, not against compiled abstractions.

## What ServerCN Is Not

To be explicit:

- Not a backend framework
- Not an ORM
- Not a runtime dependency
- Not a magic generator

> ServerCN configures your project.  
> It does **not generate or own your application**.
