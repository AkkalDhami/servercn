# Husky

Husky is a tool that allows you to easily manage Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository.

[Husky Official Docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)

## Installation

Install Husky using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add tooling husky" />

## Usage

Husky is typically used to run scripts like linting, testing, or formatting before you commit code.

Pre-commit Hook

The component sets up a <Code children="pre-commit" /> hook that often runs <Code children="lint-staged" />.

<Code children=".husky/pre-commit" />

```
npx lint-staged
```

## Benefits

- **Enforce Quality**: Prevents bad code from being committed.
- **Automate Workflows**: Link Git events to your development scripts.
- **Team Consistency**: Ensures all contributors follow the same Git hook rules.
- **Easy Management**: No need to manually configure files in `.git/hooks`.
