# Husky

Husky is a tool that allows you to easily manage Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository.

## Installation

Install Husky using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add husky" />

## Usage

Husky is typically used to run scripts like linting, testing, or formatting before you commit code.

### Pre-commit Hook

The component sets up a `pre-commit` hook that often runs `lint-staged`.

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
npx lint-staged
```

### Pre-push Hook

You can also add a `pre-push` hook to run tests before pushing to the remote repository.

```bash
# .husky/pre-push
npm test
```

## Benefits

- **Enforce Quality**: Prevents bad code from being committed.
- **Automate Workflows**: Link Git events to your development scripts.
- **Team Consistency**: Ensures all contributors follow the same Git hook rules.
- **Easy Management**: No need to manually configure files in `.git/hooks`.
