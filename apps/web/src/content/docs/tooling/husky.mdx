# Husky

Husky is a tool that allows you to easily manage Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository.

[Husky Official Docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)

## Installation

Install Husky using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add tooling husky" />

## Usage

Husky is commonly used to run tasks like linting, testing, or formatting before code is committed. This ensures that only valid, well-formatted code enters your repository.

## Pre-commit Hook

By default, this setup configures a <Code children="pre-commit" />  Git hook that runs <Code children="npm test" />.

**File:** <Code children=".husky/pre-commit" />

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

This hook executes automatically every time you attempt to create a commit.

## Benefits

- **Enforce Quality**: Prevents bad code from being committed.
- **Automate Workflows**: Link Git events to your development scripts.
- **Team Consistency**: Ensures all contributors follow the same Git hook rules.
