title: ESLint
description: A production-grade ESLint configuration for TypeScript and Express.js projects, optimized for backend reliability and team consistency.
command: npx servercn add eslint
--------------------------------

# ESLint

ESLint is a **static code analysis and linting tool** that detects problematic patterns, enforces best practices, and ensures consistent coding standards across a codebase.

In ServerCN projects, ESLint is treated as a **first-line quality gate** that:

* Prevents common runtime bugs
* Enforces consistent coding conventions
* Improves long-term maintainability
* Reduces review friction in team environments

This configuration is tailored specifically for **Node.js, TypeScript, and Express.js backends**.

---

## Installation

Install the ESLint configuration using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add eslint" />

This command automatically:

* Installs ESLint and required plugins
* Sets up a TypeScript-aware configuration
* Aligns ESLint with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts

---

## What Gets Installed

The component installs and configures the following core packages:

* <Code children="eslint" /> – Core linting engine
* <Code children="@typescript-eslint/parser" /> – TypeScript-aware parser
* <Code children="@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin" /> – TypeScript-specific rules
* <Code children="eslint-config-prettier" /> – Disables stylistic rules handled by Prettier

---

## ESLint Configuration

ServerCN provides a **sensible default configuration** focused on backend correctness rather than frontend stylistic noise.

Depending on your ESLint version, the config may be generated as either:

* <Code children=".eslintrc.json" /> (legacy)
* <Code children="eslint.config.js" /> (flat config, ESLint v9+)

Below is the canonical configuration with inline explanations.

### Example `.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "root": true,

  /**
   * Uses the TypeScript parser so ESLint can understand
   * modern TypeScript syntax and type information.
   */
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",

  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],

  "extends": [
    /**
     * Base ESLint recommended rules
     */
    "eslint:recommended",

    /**
     * Recommended rules for TypeScript projects
     */
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",

    /**
     * Disables ESLint rules that would conflict with Prettier
     */
    "prettier"
  ],

  "rules": {
    /**
     * Allow console logs but warn instead of failing builds.
     * Useful for backend diagnostics while staying disciplined.
     */
    "no-console": "warn",

    /**
     * Prevents usage of `any`, enforcing explicit and safe typing.
     * This is critical for large or long-lived codebases.
     */
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error",

    /**
     * Disabled to reduce verbosity in Express controllers
     * where return types are often obvious or inferred.
     */
    "@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "off"
  }
}
```

## Recommended Scripts

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` to standardize linting across environments:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts --fix"
  }
}
```

### Script Usage

* `npm run lint` – Runs ESLint in read-only mode
* `npm run lint:fix` – Automatically fixes safe, rule-compliant issues

---

## Prettier Compatibility

ServerCN intentionally separates **code formatting** from **code correctness**:

* ESLint focuses on logic, safety, and best practices
* Prettier handles formatting and stylistic concerns

This prevents the common ESLint–Prettier conflict and keeps responsibilities clear.

---

## Features

* **TypeScript-First**: Fully aware of TypeScript syntax and semantics
* **Backend-Oriented Rules**: Optimized for Node.js and Express APIs
* **Low Noise**: Avoids unnecessary stylistic warnings
* **CI Friendly**: Safe to run in automated pipelines
* **Extensible**: Easy to layer additional rules per project needs

---

## Best Practices

* Run `lint` locally before pushing commits
* Use `lint:fix` only on clean working trees
* Avoid disabling rules globally; prefer scoped overrides
* Pair ESLint with Commitlint and Prettier for full workflow coverage

---

## Summary

The ServerCN ESLint component provides:

* A clean, production-ready baseline
* Strong TypeScript guarantees
* Minimal friction for backend developers
* Consistent standards across teams and repositories

This makes it suitable for **serious backend systems** and **resume-grade projects**.
