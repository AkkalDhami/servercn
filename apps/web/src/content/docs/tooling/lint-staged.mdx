# Lint-Staged

Lint-Staged allows you to run linters against staged git files and don't let 💩 slip into your code base!

## Installation

Install Lint-Staged using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add lint-staged" />

## Configuration

The component adds a `lint-staged` configuration to your `package.json` or creates a `.lintstagedrc` file.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "src/**/*.ts": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. You stage your changes with `git add`.
2. You run `git commit`.
3. Husky triggers the `pre-commit` hook.
4. `lint-staged` runs defined commands only on the files that are about to be committed.
5. If everything passes, the commit is successful.

## Features

- **Efficiency**: Only runs linting on changed files, not the whole project.
- **Auto-fix**: Can automatically fix formatting issues before committing.
- **Speed**: significantly faster than running a full lint check on every commit.
