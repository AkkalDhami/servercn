# Commitizen

Commitizen is a tool that helps you create conventional commit messages through an interactive CLI prompt.

## Installation

Install Commitizen using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add commitizen" />

## Usage

Instead of using `git commit`, you use `git cz` (or `npm run commit`) to start the interactive prompt.

### Interactive Prompt

When you run the command, you will be asked:
1. Select the type of change.
2. What is the scope of this change?
3. Write a short, imperative tense description of the change.
4. Provide a longer description of the change.
5. Are there any breaking changes?
6. Does this change affect any open issues?

## Benefits

- **Standardization**: Ensures all team members use the same commit format.
- **Easy for Beginners**: No need to memorize conventional commit rules.
- **Better History**: Creates a meaningful and searchable git history.
- **Changelog Generation**: Makes it easy to generate automated changelogs.
