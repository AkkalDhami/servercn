# Graceful Shutdown Handler

Graceful shutdown handling for Node.js and Express servers.

The **Graceful Shutdown Handler** ensures that your ServerCN application terminates safely and predictably when the process receives shutdown signals such as `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`. It allows the server to stop accepting new connections, complete in-flight requests, release resources, and exit cleanly without data loss.


## Why Graceful Shutdown Matters

In production environments—containers, process managers, CI/CD pipelines, or orchestration platforms—applications are frequently restarted or terminated.

Without a graceful shutdown mechanism, your server may:

- Drop active HTTP requests
- Leave database connections open
- Interrupt background jobs
- Cause unexpected client-side errors during deployments

ServerCN provides a standardized and reusable shutdown lifecycle for production systems.


## Features

- Listens to system termination signals
- Stops accepting new HTTP connections
- Waits for ongoing requests to complete
- Supports async cleanup hooks
- Configurable shutdown timeout
- Centralized and predictable shutdown flow


## Installation

Install the component using the ServerCN CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn add shutdown-handler" />

## Basic Usage

### Create the Graceful Shutdown Handler

```ts
import { createGracefulShutdown } from "@/servercn/graceful-shutdown";

const shutdown = createGracefulShutdown({
  server,
  timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds
});
