# Todo App Schema

The **Todo App Schema** provides a robust foundation for building task management applications. It includes a complete set of fields for managing tasks, tracking completion status, and associating todos with users.

## Database Variants

The Todo schema is available for multiple databases:

1. **[MongoDB (Mongoose)](/docs/schemas/todo-mongodb)** - Using Mongoose models with full type safety.
2. **[PostgreSQL (Drizzle)](/docs/schemas/todo-postgresql)** - Type-safe Drizzle schemas for PostgreSQL.
3. **[MySQL (Drizzle)](/docs/schemas/todo-mysql)** - Type-safe Drizzle schemas for MySQL.

## Features

- **User Association**: Links todos to specific users.
- **Auto Timestamps**: Automatically tracks creation and update times.
- **Flexible Data**: Support for titles, descriptions, and completion status.
- **Type Safety**: Fully typed models and schemas for both Mongoose and Drizzle.

## Quick Start

### Install Todo Schema

To add the Todo schema to your project, run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn-cli add schema todo" />

This will install the appropriate schema file based on your project's database configuration.

## Schema Breakdown

### 1. Todo Model

The **Todo Model** is the core component for storing task information.

**Key Fields:**

- <Code children="userId" />: Reference to the user who owns the task.
- <Code children="title" />: The title of the task (required).
- <Code children="description" />: Optional detailed description of the task.
- <Code children="completed" />: Boolean flag indicating if the task is finished.
- <Code children="createdAt" />: When the task was created.
- <Code children="updatedAt" />: When the task was last updated.

**View Documentation: [MongoDB](/docs/schemas/todo-mongodb) | [PostgreSQL](/docs/schemas/todo-postgresql) | [MySQL](/docs/schemas/todo-mysql)**

## Relationship Design

The Todo schema is designed to work seamlessly with the [Auth Domain](/docs/schemas/auth). It maintains a one-to-many relationship:
- One **User** (from Auth Domain) can have many **Todos**.
- One **Todo** belongs to exactly one **User**.

### Integration with Auth
This schema assumes you have the **Auth Domain** installed. The   
<Code children="userId" /> field acts as a foreign key (PostgreSQL/MySQL) or reference (MongoDB) to the <Code children="User" /> model. This allows you to:
- Enforce data ownership.
- Fetch todos for a specific authenticated user.
- Automatically delete todos when a user account is deleted (Cascading).

To install the Auth Domain alongside Todos:
<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn-cli add schema auth" />
