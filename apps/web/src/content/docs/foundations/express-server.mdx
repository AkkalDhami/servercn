# Express Server Foundation

The **Express Server Foundation** is the core starting block provided by **servercn**. When you run:

## Installation Guide

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn init express-server" />

you get a **production‑ready Express.js server** with a clean, scalable foundation and sensible defaults. This foundation eliminates repetitive setup and lets you focus immediately on business logic.

This is not a framework. It is a **well‑structured boilerplate** you fully own.

## Example Server

```ts
import express, { Express, Request, Response } from "express";
import "dotenv/config";
import cors from "cors";
import helmet from "helmet";
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
import morgan from "morgan";
import { notFoundHandler } from "./middlewares/not-found-handler";
import { errorHandler } from "./middlewares/error-handler";
import healthRoutes from "./routes/health.routes";
import env from "./configs/env";

const app: Express = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true
  })
);
app.use(helmet());
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(morgan(env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "dev" : "combined"));

// Routes

app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.redirect("/api/v1/health");
});

app.use("/api/v1/health", healthRoutes);

// Not found handler (should be after routes)
app.use(notFoundHandler);

// Global error handler (should be last)
app.use(errorHandler);

export default app;
```

## What This Foundation Solves

Most Express projects repeat the same setup:

- Environment configuration
- CORS and cookie handling
- Standard API response format
- Centralized error handling
- TypeScript configuration
- Development tooling

The Express Server Foundation standardizes these concerns using **battle‑tested patterns**.

## What You Get Out of the Box

After initialization, your project includes:

### Core Setup

- Express.js server
- TypeScript configured
- Nodemon for development

### Configuration

- Environment variable loader
- Strict environment validation
- Centralized config access

### Middleware

- CORS (preconfigured)
- Cookie Parser
- JSON & URL‑encoded body parsing
- Request logging

### Response Handling

- Standard API response formatter
- Consistent success and error payloads

### Error Handling

- Custom API error class
- Centralized error handler middleware
- Safe production error responses

### Developer Experience

- Hot reload with nodemon
- Typed request/response helpers
- Clean project structure

## Standard Response Format

All API responses follow a predictable structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request successful",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {}
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid request",
  "statusCode": 400,
  "errors": []
}
```

This makes frontend integration consistent and predictable.

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables are loaded and validated at startup.

```bash
PORT='5000'
NODE_ENV='development'
LOG_LEVEL='info'
CORS_ORIGIN='http://localhost:3000'
```

If a required variable is missing, the server fails fast instead of crashing later.

## Error Handling Strategy

The foundation includes a centralized error pipeline:

1. Route throws or forwards an error
2. Custom <Code children='ApiError' /> normalizes it
3. Error handler formats the response
4. Stack traces are hidden in production

This ensures **safe error exposure** in production.

## CORS & Cookies

CORS is preconfigured with:

- Credential support
- Environment‑based origin control

Cookies are handled using <Code children="cookie-parser" /> with TypeScript support.

## Development Workflow

### Start development server

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run dev" />

### Build for production

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run build" />

### Start production server

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm start" />

## Why This Is a Foundation (Not a Template)

This setup intentionally excludes:

- Authentication
- Database configuration
- Business logic

Those are added using **servercn components and blocks**.

The foundation gives you:

- A clean starting point
- Proven defaults
- Freedom to evolve

## Extending the Foundation

Once initialized, you can add:

- JWT Authentication block
- Request validation (Zod)
- Logging and monitoring
- Database adapters

Each addition builds on top of this foundation without rewriting core setup.

## When to Use Express Server Foundation

Use this foundation when:

- Starting a new Express API
- Building a production REST backend
- You want full control over your server
- You want consistent structure across projects

## Summary

The **Express Server Foundation** is the recommended starting point for any Express‑based backend using servercn.

It removes setup friction while keeping your architecture explicit, understandable, and production‑ready.
