# Drizzle MySQL Starter

The **Drizzle MySQL Starter** is a database foundation provided by **servercn** for projects that use **MySQL with Drizzle ORM**. When you run:

## Installation Guide

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx servercn init drizzle-mysql-starter" />

you get a **production‑ready MySQL + Drizzle setup** that integrates cleanly with the Express Server Foundation.

This starter focuses on **type‑safe database access, clear schema ownership, and predictable migrations**, without hiding SQL or introducing heavy abstractions.

## What This Starter Solves

Setting up Drizzle with MySQL repeatedly involves:

- Database connection management
- Schema organization
- Migration configuration
- Environment‑based credentials
- Type safety across queries

The Drizzle MySQL Starter standardizes these concerns using a **minimal, explicit setup**.

## What You Get Out of the Box

After initialization, your project includes:

### Database Core

- Drizzle ORM configured for MySQL
- Type‑safe schema definitions
- Centralized database client

### Configuration

- Environment‑based database config
- Safe startup validation
- Production‑ready connection handling

### Migrations

- Drizzle migration setup
- Structured migration folder
- CLI‑ready workflow

### Developer Experience

- Fully typed queries
- Clean schema organization
- Zero runtime magic

## Environment Configuration

Database credentials are loaded via environment variables.

```bash
NODE_ENV='development'
PORT='9000'
LOG_LEVEL='info'

DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/db-name
```

The server fails fast if required database variables are missing.

## Defining Schemas

Schemas are written using Drizzle’s SQL‑first, type‑safe API.

<Code children="src/drizzle/schema.ts" />

```ts
import { mysqlTable, serial, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/mysql-core";

export const usersTable = mysqlTable("users", {
  id: serial().primaryKey(),
  name: varchar({ length: 255 }).notNull(),
  email: varchar({ length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
  password: varchar("password", { length: 255 }).notNull()
});
```

Schemas are:

- Explicit
- Version‑controlled
- Fully typed across queries

## Database Client Setup

<Code children="src/configs/db.ts" /> or <Code children="src/db/db.ts" />

```ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";
import env from "./env";

const db = drizzle(env.DATABASE_URL!);

export default db;
```

No repositories or hidden layers — you interact directly with Drizzle.

## Migrations Workflow

### Generate migrations

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run db:generate" />

### Apply migrations

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run db:migrate" />

Migrations are SQL‑first and fully auditable.

### Database Studio

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run db:studio" />

## Production Considerations

The starter is designed for production:

- No dynamic schema generation at runtime
- Controlled migration execution
- Environment‑safe credentials
- Predictable connection behavior

## Integration with Express Server Foundation

The Drizzle MySQL Starter is designed to layer cleanly on top of:

- Express Server Foundation
- Request validation (Zod)
- Auth and RBAC blocks

This keeps responsibilities separated:

- Express handles HTTP
- Drizzle handles data

## Why This Is a Starter (Not an ORM Wrapper)

This setup intentionally avoids:

- Custom query builders
- Repository patterns by default
- Magic decorators

You write SQL‑like queries with **full type safety**.

## When to Use Drizzle MySQL Starter

Use this starter when:

- You want type‑safe MySQL access
- You prefer explicit schema control
- You want predictable migrations
- You are building production APIs

## Extending the Starter

Once initialized, you can add:

- Relations and joins
- Soft deletes
- Indexes and constraints
- Transaction helpers
- TTL or archival strategies

Each extension builds on the same explicit schema foundation.

## Summary

The **Drizzle MySQL Starter** gives you a clean, production‑ready database foundation using **MySQL + Drizzle ORM**.

It prioritizes clarity, type safety, and long‑term maintainability — without taking control away from you.
